# Regression check for the guest-agent provenance policy in
# crates/filesystem/build.rs.
#
# `agentd` is compiled into the host binary, so embedding an artifact that does
# not belong to this tree changes guest-side behaviour without failing anything
# else. The policy is therefore: a checkout always embeds its own build/agentd,
# and fails when that artifact is stale or missing, while a build with no guest
# source tree at all - a published crate - may embed the released artifact.
#
# The interesting cases are failures, so each one asserts the message a developer
# needs, not merely a non-zero exit. The consumer-side branches (released
# download, reused OUT_DIR copy) cannot be exercised from inside the repository;
# they are covered by the probe described in the commit that added this script.
#
# Everything this script moves or touches is restored on exit, and the artifact
# is re-stamped as fresh so a developer's next build is not rejected as stale.
